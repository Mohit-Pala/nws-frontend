	are considered very different and unrelated, potentially identifying clickbait.

	adjacent words in a text. For example, in "the quick brown fox", the bigrams are "the quick", "quick brown", and "brown fox".
	A higher score for Jaccard Similarity with bigrams (closer to 1) means that the title and the article share a larger proportion of 
	the same two-word phrases and indicates a more direct textual overlap in phrasing. A score closer to 0 means they share very few common two-word phrases.
